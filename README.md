# Task Manager
My friend's father told me that I should learn how to use GoLang, so I decided on this full-stack web application.


## Goals
### Main
I want to learn a new programming/scripting language.
1. Learn how to use GoLang
2. Learn how to use AWS
3. Use a third-party (aka: Google Calendar)

### This isn't...
I'm not trying to make this look amazing. It should just look relatively simple.\
Some styling, but not overboard.


## Implementation
- Frontend: Next.JS
- Backend: GoLang
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT
- Deployment: Docker
- Services: AWS
